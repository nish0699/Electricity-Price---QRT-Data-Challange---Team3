# Project Title: Ensemble Analysis Group 2 - Team 3

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore, preprocess, and model a dataset to uncover insights and predict outcomes effectively. Conducted by Group 2, Team 3, the project is structured into three main components: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Preprocessing, and Modeling. Each component is detailed in separate Jupyter notebooks to maintain clarity and focus on specific objectives.

## Team Members
- Anna PARSHIKOVA,  
- Josué LABRÍN, 
- Mariana JIMENEZ VEGA, 
- Nishtha KHURANA

## File Descriptions
- `EDA_Project_Ensemble_Group2_Team3.ipynb`: This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset. It includes data visualization, identification of patterns, and preliminary data cleaning steps.
- `PreProcessing_Project_Ensemble_Group2_Team3.ipynb`: Focuses on data preprocessing techniques applied to the dataset to prepare it for modeling. It covers handling missing values, feature engineering, outlier detection and removal, and data normalization.
- `Modeling_Project_Ensemble_Group2_Team3.ipynb`: Contains the modeling process, including the selection of models, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Project Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To understand the dataset by visualizing the data, identifying patterns, and highlighting key relationships.
- **Preprocessing**: To clean and prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing data, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Modeling**: To build predictive models that can accurately forecast outcomes based on the processed data, utilizing various machine learning techniques.

## Usage
To explore each component of the project:
- **EDA**: Start with the EDA notebook to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- **Preprocessing**: Proceed to the preprocessing notebook for insights into the data cleaning and preparation steps.
- **Modeling**: Finally, review the modeling notebook to see the predictive models developed and their performance.
